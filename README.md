It is the premier men's professional basketball league in the world.

Hall Of Fame The Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame is located in the home of basketball in Springfield, Massachusetts. It is named after the man who invented basketball – James Naismith. The Hall of Fame was created in 1959, and opened to the public only in 1968. This includes coaches, players, and figures who have contributed to the development of basketball. The Basketball Hall of Fame is designed to immortalize the brightest basketball stars and the best moments of the game. It remains the world’s best sports museum.
